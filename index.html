    <p>Hi! My name is Nusrat Islam. This website is a portfolio of programming skills that I learned in CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. I created these webpages using HTML and CSS, while the Javascripts page (obviously) has programs that are created with Javascript. I also have an apps page that can be run on phones. Enjoy!
